This is the Github repo for my Github Pages site at [sprow.dev](https://sprow.dev)

The repo is not private because I don't want to pay for extra features, and a few dollars a year is all I'm willing to do because this is run on a purely hobby basis.

By the way, if there are any ssl errors let me know in the issues tab of this project. Sometimes I change things and it ends up breaking the ssl cert of the main page.
