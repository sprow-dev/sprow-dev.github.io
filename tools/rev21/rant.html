<p>There is this guy who is so infuriating who for this rant will be called George.
    He hates people pretty much, which begs the question of how he is in a social environment.
    Honestly, at this point he should be like a sewer worker because he is so bad at socializing.
    Anyway, he is always trying to gaslight you and then gaslight you about not gaslighting you.
    He also is overall really rude and tries to gaslight you into thinking you gaslighted him.
    At this point, he is a gaslight. It is that bad. He just hates people to be honest.
    He is unbearable to be around because he also is just really rude about everything I do.
    I do one thing "wrong" and he decides to yell at me for the whole rest of the day.
    Finally, he is always blaming me for everything and getting mad at me for stuff I did 5+ years ago.
    I'll add more later, but I am grateful he is leaving soon, and hopefully, I won't have to add any more.
